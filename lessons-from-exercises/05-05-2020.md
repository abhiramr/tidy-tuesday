The only difference is in the "sep" and "dec" arguments in both functions. In some countries, "." is a decimal point, while in others, "," is used.
Similarly, in the countries where "," is a decimal point, the "comma" separater is the semicolon(;). Hence read_csv and read_csv2 are used as applicable.
